• A teacher will be required to correct exam scripts at a payment of €10.18 per script.<br>
• If a teacher is absent, €62.68 will be deducted from their pay for each day that they are
absent.<br><br>
### Teachers (Part time)<br><br>

<br><br>All employees are taxed at 22% on the first €40, 000 earned, and at 42% on any money earned over €40, 000.
<br><br>All employees pay 4% PRSI.<br>
<br>Design, code and test a program that will read in the PPS number of an employee (the format of a PPS number is 7 digits followed by a letter). Once a PPS number is entered, the user will be asked if they are calculating the pay details for a principal or a teacher (full time or part time). The program should then read in the required details and output the employee’s PPS number, their gross pay, their tax, their PRSI and their take-home pay. It is up to you how you present their pay details, but the output should be professional.
<br><br>The program should loop until the user does not want to calculate any further wages.<br><br>You are required to use inheritance as effectively as possible.
